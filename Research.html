    <h1>Ants</h1>
    <h4>In the past several years, there are some important discoveries in the texonomy of ants</h4>

    <h5>Here we providing some of them</h5><br><br>

    <h3>Of ants and Men</h3>
    <p>Parallels between the ants and ourselves are striking for the light they shed on the nature of everyday human
        experiences. Some ants get forced into low-status jobs and are prevented from becoming upwardly mobile by other
        members of the colony. Garbage dump workers, for example, are confined to their humble and dangerous task of
        removing rubbish from the nest by other ants who respond aggressively to the odors that linger on the garbage
        workers’ bodies. <br>

        Some of the most fascinating insights into ants have come from researchers who measure the amount of carbon
        dioxide given off by colonies. This is rather like measuring the respiration rate in humans in that it gives an
        indication of the amount of work the superorganism is doing. The researchers discovered (perhaps unsurprisingly)
        that colonies experiencing internal conflict between individuals seeking to become reproductively dominant
        produce more CO2 than do tranquil colonies where the social order is long established. But extraordinarily, they
        also discovered that about three hours after removing a queen ant, the CO2 emissions from a colony drop.
        “Removing the queen thus has a clear effect on worker behavior, apparently reducing their inclination to work
        for the colony,” the researchers concluded. While it is dangerous to anthropomorphize, it seems that ants may
        have their periods of mourning just as we humans do when a great leader passes from us. <br>

        However, ants clearly are fundamentally different from us. A whimsical example concerns the work of ant
        morticians, which recognize ant corpses purely on the basis of the presence of a product of decomposition called
        oleic acid. When researchers daub live ants with the acid, the undertakers promptly carry off the acid-daubed
        ants to the ant cemetery, despite the fact that they are alive and kicking. Indeed, unless they clean themselves
        very thoroughly they are repeatedly dragged to the mortuary, despite showing every other sign of life. <br>

        The means that ants use to find their way in the world are fascinating. It has recently been found that ant
        explorers count their steps to determine where they are in relation to home. This remarkable ability was
        discovered by researchers who lengthened the legs of ants by attaching stilts to them. The stilt-walking ants,
        they observed, became lost on their way home to the nest at a distance proportionate to the length of their
        stilts. <br>

        The principal tools ants use, however, in guiding their movements and actions are potent chemical signals known
        as pheromones. So pervasive and sophisticated are pheromones in coordinating actions among ants that it’s
        appropriate to think of ants as “speaking” to each other through pheromones. Around forty different
        pheromone-producing glands have been discovered in ants, and, although no single species has all forty glands,
        enough diversity of signaling is present to allow for the most sophisticated interactions. The fire ant, for
        example, uses just a few glands to produce its eighteen pheromone signals, yet this number, along with two
        visual signals, is sufficient to allow its large and sophisticated colonies to function. <br>

        Pheromone trails are laid by ants as they travel, and along well-used routes these trails take on the
        characteristics of a superhighway. From the ant’s perspective, they are three-dimensional tunnels perhaps a
        centimeter wide that lead to food, a garbage dump, or home. If you wipe your finger across the trail of ants
        raiding your sugar bowl, you can demonstrate how important the pheromone trail is: as the ants reach the spot
        where your finger erased their trail they will become confused and turn back or wander. The chemicals used to
        mark such trails are extraordinarily potent. Just one milligram of the trail pheromone used by some species of
        attine ants to guide workers to leaf-cutting sites is enough to lay an ant superhighway sixty times around the
        earth. <br>

        Ant sex seems utterly alien. Except for short periods just before the mating season, when an ant colony is
        reproducing, it is composed entirely of females, and among some primitive species virgin births are common. All
        the offspring of such virgin mothers, however, are winged males that almost invariably leave the nest. If a
        female ant mates, however, all of her fertilized eggs become females. In many ant societies, reproduction is the
        prerogative of a single individual—the queen. She mates soon after leaving her natal colony and stores the sperm
        from that mating (or from multiple matings) all of her life, using it to fertilize (in some cases) millions of
        eggs over ten or more years. <br>

        The progress of ants from this relatively primitive state to the complexity of the most finely tuned
        superorganisms leaves no doubt that the progress of human evolution has largely followed a path taken by the
        ants millions of years earlier. Beginning as simple hunter-gatherers, some ants have learned to herd and milk
        bugs, just as we milk cattle and sheep. There are ants that take slaves, ants that lay their eggs in the nests
        of foreign ants (much as cuckoos do among birds), leaving the upbringing of their young to others, and there are
        even ants that have discovered agriculture. These agricultural ants represent the highest level of ant
        civilization, yet it is not plants that they cultivate but mushrooms. These mushroom farmers are known as
        attines, and they are found only in the New World. Widely known as leafcutter ants, they are doubtless familiar
        from wildlife documentaries. <br>

        The attines, say Hölldobler and Wilson, are “Earth’s ultimate superorganisms,” and there is no doubt that their
        status is due to their agricultural economy, which they developed 50 to 60 million years before humans sowed the
        first seed. Indeed, it is in the changes wrought in attine societies by agriculture that the principal interest
        for the student of human societies lies. The most sophisticated of attine ant species has a single queen in a
        colony of millions of sterile workers that vary greatly in size and shape, the largest being two-hundred times
        heavier than the smallest. Their system of worker specialization is so intricate that it recalls Swift’s ditty
        on fleas: <br>
        <br>
        So, naturalists observe, a flea <br>
        Has smaller fleas that on him prey; <br>
        And these have smaller still to bite ‘em; <br>
        And so proceed ad infinitum. <br>
        <br>
        In the case of the attines, however, the varying size classes have specific jobs to do. Some cut a piece from a
        leaf and drop it to the ground, while others carry the leaf fragment to a depot. From there others carry it to
        the nest, where smaller ants cut it into fragments. Then ants that are smaller still take these pieces and crush
        and mold them into pellets, which even smaller ants plant out with strands of fungus. Finally, the very smallest
        ants, known as minims, weed and tend the growing fungus bed. These minute and dedicated gardeners do get an
        occasional outing, however, for they are known to walk to where the leaves are being cut and hitch a ride back
        to the nest on a leaf fragment. Their purpose in doing this is to protect the carrier ants from parasitic flies
        that would otherwise attack them. Clearly, not only did the attines beat us to agriculture, but they exemplified
        the concept of the division of labor long before Adam Smith stated it. <br>

        You may not believe it, but, like the sailors of old, the leafcutter ants “sing” as they work. Leaf-cutting is
        every bit as strenuous for the ants as hauling an anchor is for human beings, and their singing, which takes the
        form of stridulation (a sound created by the rubbing together of body parts), assists the ants in their work by
        imparting vibrations to the mandible that is cutting the leaf, enhancing its action in a manner akin to the way
        an electric knife helps us cut roasts. The leafcutters also use stridulation to cry for help, for example when
        workers are trapped in an underground cave-in. These cries for help soon prompt other ants to rush in and begin
        digging until they’ve reached their trapped sisters. <br>

        One can hardly help but admire the intelligence of the ant colony, yet theirs is an intelligence of a very
        particular kind. “Nothing in the brain of a worker ant represents a blueprint of the social order,” Hölldobler
        and Wilson tell us, and there is no overseer or “brain caste” that carries such a master plan in its head.
        Instead, the ants have discovered how to create strength from weakness by pooling their individually limited
        capacities into a collective decision-making system that bears an uncanny resemblance to our own democratic
        processes.

    <h3>Progres of the species and the biodiversity of ants</h3>
    <p>Simple Summary
        Ants fulfill an important ecological function, not only serving as one of the main decomposers but also playing
        a role in improving soil fertility. Ants may conflict with humans as a pest species in homes and living
        facilities (e.g., closets, wardrobes, cabinets, and tables), as well as in outdoor facilities (e.g., tables,
        chairs, and benches). In addition, ants and humans can come into conflict in green spaces (including parks,
        gardens, and tourist attractions) and can seriously interfere with outdoor leisure and the life and
        entertainment activities of people (especially children). Therefore, it is a matter of public health and
        environmental protection to ensure ant prevention by adopting green control technology and not merely by
        spraying pesticides to kill them. This review mainly focuses on the species and diversity of ants, especially in
        China, and the research progress of ant tropism regarding phototaxis, chromotaxis, and chemotaxis (i.e.,
        3-tropisms). Moreover, current research on repellent substances is also summarized, analyzed, and discussed in
        order to help the application of green prevention and control technology for ant diversity protection and
        conservation, especially in daily home life and entertainment activities. This field of research is related to
        ensuring the healthy life of the public and the protection of the ecological environment.
        Abstract
        Ants are one of the largest insect groups, with the most species and individuals in the world, and they have an
        important ecological function. Ants are not only an important part of the food chains but are also one of the
        main decomposers on the Earth; they can also improve soil fertility, etc. However, some species of ants are
        harmful to human beings, which leads to people’s panic or worry about coming into contact with these insects
        during their daily home life or in their tourism or leisure activities. The presence of ants in indoor living
        facilities and in outdoor green spaces, parks, gardens, and tourist attractions seriously interferes with the
        leisure life and entertainment activities of all people (especially children). How can we control ants in these
        environments? Do we kill them by spraying insecticides, or do we adopt green prevention and control technology
        for the ecological management of ants? This topic is related to healthy life for the public and the protection
        of the ecological environment. In this paper, the species and diversity of ants are introduced, and research
        progress regarding ant tropism is introduced according to the three aspects of phototaxis, chromotaxis, and
        chemotaxis (i.e., “3-tropisms”). The research on repellent substances from plants and insects and the related
        ant attractants are also summarized, analyzed, and discussed, in order to help the research and application of
        green prevention and control technology for ant diversity protection and conservation.

        1. Introduction
        Ants are one of the most diverse and abundant animal groups in the world, and they can be found everywhere, with
        more than 10,000 species [1]. Among them, many species are harmful to people (such as Solenopsis invicta,
        Monomorium pharaonis, etc.), and they are listed as high-priority quarantine pests by many countries [2]. These
        harmful ants will cause serious consequences after stinging people, resulting in people’s panic or worry about
        coming into contact with these ants in their daily home life or during outdoor tourism activities.
        Ants may conflict with humans as a pest species in homes and living facilities (such as in closets, wardrobes,
        cabinets, and tables, etc.), as well as outdoor facilities (such as tables, chairs, benches, etc.). In addition,
        ants and humans can come into conflict in green spaces (including parks, gardens, and tourist attractions) and
        they can seriously interfere with the public leisure and entertainment activities of people (especially
        children). Ants can also damage agricultural equipment [3]. In addition, the problem of fire ants, leafcutter
        ants, termites, and other insects is very serious in tropical areas, causing extensive damage to crops and
        reforestation [4]. However, ants have an important ecological function; they are an important part of the food
        chain in ecosystems, not only serving as one of the main decomposers on the Earth but also playing a role in
        improving soil fertility. In nature, the ecological function of ants is equivalent to that of cleaners,
        shouldering the important task of purifying the environment, and they are also a food source and natural enemies
        for many animals. In addition to feeding on seeds, these ants can also, therefore, accidentally disperse them
        [5]. Also, they perform important ecosystem services such as pest control [6]. Therefore, it can be seen that
        the niches that they occupy are too important to be replaced by other organisms.
        Even though ants are frequently encountered in people’s daily home life or in tourism and leisure activities,
        they must not be arbitrarily killed; harmless green management technology should be adopted to carry out the
        comprehensive prevention and control of ant colonies in order to protect diversity and for conservation purposes
        in these environments. Ecological pest control using insect tropism is considered to be an effective way to
        achieve green ecological pest control. Tropism is the directional behavioral response of insects to external
        stimuli. Among them, those who move in the direction of the stimulus are called positive taxis (i.e.,
        seduction), and those who move away from the direction of the stimulus are negative taxis (i.e., avoidance).
        According to the nature of the stimulus sources, insect taxis mainly include phototaxis, chemotaxis,
        chromotaxis, thermotaxis, and humidity taxis, among which phototaxis, chemotaxis, and chromotaxis (namely, the
        “3-tropisms”) are widely used in pest control, monitoring, and early warnings [7,8,9,10,11,12]. At present,
        inductive killing and repellent technologies have been widely used in the monitoring and control of
        disease-carrying insects (such as mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, fleas, etc.) [13]. In order to better carry
        out the comprehensive green and harmless prevention and control of ants in daily home life or during tourism and
        leisure activities, the diversity of ant species and their phototaxis, chromatism, and chemotaxis (the
        “3-tropisms”) have been reviewed and analyzed in this paper.
        2. Ant Species and Diversity in China
        Ants belong to the Hymenoptera group of insects in the family Formicidae. They have many ecological functions,
        such as pollinating plants, controlling pests, improving soil fertility, and maintaining ecological balance etc.
        At present, a total of 14,084 species of ants have been found, belonging to 347 genera, and with 16 subfamilies
        [1]. There are more than 800 species of ants known in China, the most common ones being the small yellow house
        ant (also known as the Pharaoh ant), big-headed ant, sword-jawed smelly house ant, smelly ant, black ant, etc.
        According to the published domestic literature in China [14,15,16,17,18,19,20], there are a total of 863 species
        of ants known in China, totaling 7 subfamilies and 90 genera (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials).</p>
